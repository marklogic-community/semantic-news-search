            <p class="introduction">A criminal inquiry
has been launched in Canada into the derailment of an oil train
that killed at least 15 people in a small Quebec town on
Saturday.</p>
            <p>Quebec police inspector Michel Forget said investigators had
found evidence leading them toward a criminal probe.</p>
            <p>The runaway train derailed in the town of Lac-Megantic,
exploding and destroying dozens of buildings.</p>
            <p>Investigators are focusing on whether the brakes were released
as it was parked in a town several miles away.</p>

            <p>In addition to the dead, as many as 35
others remain unaccounted for. Authorities have asked the relatives
of the missing to provide DNA samples by bringing in toothbrushes,
hairbrushes, razors and other items.</p>
            <p>But the authorities have also warned some of the bodies may have
been burnt to ashes in the explosion and may never be
recovered.</p>
            <p>The train, carrying 72 cars of crude oil, was parked shortly
before midnight on Friday in the town of Nantes about seven miles
(11km) away.</p>
            <p>An engineer apparently left the train with four of its five
locomotives shut down, but kept the final one running to ensure the
brakes were engaged.</p>
            <p>Soon, a Nantes fire crew was summoned to
put out a blaze on the train.</p>
            <p>For some reason, the train's brakes apparently failed soon
after. It began moving downhill on the track and over its 18-minute
journey, gathered speed until it derailed in Lac-Megantic and
exploded.</p>
            <p>"The extent to which [the fire] played into the sequences of
events is a focal point of our investigation," Transportation
Safety Board investigator Donald Ross said.</p>
            <p>Nantes Fire Chief Patrick Lambert said that while his crews
tackled the initial blaze, the final locomotive was shut down.</p>
            <p>He said this was the standard operating procedure agreed with
the train's US owner, Montreal, Maine &amp; Atlantic Railway
(MMA).</p>
            <p>But MMA maintains the decision to shut off the locomotive to put
out the fire could have disabled the brakes.</p>

            <p>At least 30 buildings were destroyed by the fireball that
resulted from Saturday morning's explosion, including a store and
the public library.</p>
            <p>Maude Verrault, a waitress at the Musi-Cafe, a nightspot razed
by the blast, was outside smoking when she spotted the runaway
train.</p>
            <p>"I've never seen a train moving so fast in my life, and I saw
flames," she told the Associated Press news agency.</p>
            <p>"Then someone screamed, 'the train is going to derail!' And
that's when I ran."</p>

            <p>It is difficult to sum up the sense of shock that has engulfed
this close-knit community.</p>
            <p>Life in the town beside the lake is normally so very tranquil
and polite. But in the early hours of Saturday morning the
French-speaking residents of Lac-Megantic had their peace shattered
- in possibly the most violent and horrendous way imaginable.</p>
            <p>The heart of the town has been destroyed. As tends to be the
case in such circumstances, everyone knows somebody who was
affected. One man I spoke to had lost five of his neighbours - as
well as the home in which he grew up.</p>
            <p>Oil trains have been rolling through this part of Canada for
years - their cargo growing increasingly larger in accordance with
heightened demand for crude. Some here saw this as a disaster
waiting to happen. Now Lac-Megantic faces the long and painful task
of rebuilding.</p>
