medicines</span>
            </div>
            <p class="introduction">China has launched a
wide-ranging investigation into the cost of medicines, probing as
many as 60 domestic and international drugmakers.</p>
            <p>It comes just days after it started a probe into price fixing of
infant milk by foreign companies - a move which has already spurred
price cuts.</p>
            <p>Foreign firms affected by the latest investigation include
GlaxoSmithKline, Merck, Astellas and Baxter Healthcare.</p>
            <p>Analysts said authorities were keen to make healthcare more
affordable.</p>
            <p>"It's not surprising there's pressure on these two industries,"
said Ben Cavender of China Market Research Group in Shanghai.</p>
            <p>He explained that the Chinese consumers' trust in domestically
made products in these segments is very low, amid concerns about
safety and counterfeit products.</p>
            <p>"That's driving consumers to spend extra to buy foreign
products," he added.</p>
            <p>He said that given the higher prices of foreign products it has
become "a social issue" amid concerns that those who can not afford
to pay extra don't have access to safer products.</p>
            <p>The National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) said that
it would look into the costs and pricing of the companies, so that
drug prices can be adjusted in a timely manner.</p>
            <p>China, the world's most populous nation, has become increasingly
important for pharmaceutical companies seeking growth.</p>
            <p>And as the country's population ages, demand for medicines is
expected to grow further in the coming years.</p>
            <p>According to some estimates, China is likely to overtake Japan
as the world's second biggest drug market after the US in the next
two to three years.</p>
